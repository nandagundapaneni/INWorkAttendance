# INWorkAttendance

Installation instructions:

1. I developed this code with Xcode 8.3.3 and deployment target is iOS 10.3
2. Unzip the file and go into main project folder and from terminal make a pod install.
3. Now INWorkAttendance.xcworkspace
4. Should compile without any problems in the simulator or onto a device if compiling onto a device make sure you select a team I did make xCode manages signing.
5. I tried to keep the UI as simple as possible it wont be hard to figure the functionality.
